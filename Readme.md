## Built With

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Android project builder(assembler).
Google chose Gradle as the official build tool for Android; not because build scripts are code, but because Gradle is modeled in a way that is extensible in the most fundamental ways. Gradle's model also allows it to be used for native development with C/C++ and can be expanded to cover any ecosystem. For example, Gradle is designed with embedding in mind using its Tooling API.
